# aoe2icm server

This package is the server code for AOE2 ICM. Run the development server by running `npm run watch`. This will spin up a dev server on port 8000 (or whatever the `$PORT` env variable is.)

## Development

Copy .env.example to .env and remove all values aside from `ENV` the other values are used strictly for the production process run by pm2.
